Before vs After Data Virtualization
This document highlights the key differences between the traditional data integration approach (Before Data Virtualization) and the modern approach enabled by Data Virtualization (After).

Aspect

Before Data Virtualization

After Data Virtualization

Data Access & Integration

Data stored in silos, heavy ETL/ELT needed, integration is slow.

Unified logical data layer, real-time access across sources.

Data Movement

Data replication and physical movement required, storage-heavy.

Minimal/no replication, queries run virtually across sources.

Agility & Time-to-Insight

Long development cycles, slow to adapt to changes.

Faster development, real-time insights, agile to changes.

Data Governance & Security

Multiple copies make governance and security harder.

Centralized governance, consistent access control.

Performance

Depends on central data warehouse design, latency from batch processes.

Optimized queries, caching, near real-time access.

Costs

High infrastructure and ETL maintenance costs.

Reduced storage and development costs, leaner operations.
